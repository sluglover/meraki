Written by Christopher Corby, 11/26/21

This script tracks the status of MX and Z1 devices for an organization and creates and sends a html table and a csv file of the data through an email.

History:  
 11/26/21 cmc Created
 12/11/21 cmc Finished working version
 12/18/21 cmc Updated the log to only track changes between active and inactive and vice versa with time stamp
 12/23/21 cmc Fixed bug of finding the difference between datetime objects for logging time a device was down
 12/29/21 cmc Updated to a correct reflection of changes in state
 1/7/22 cmc Started testing html field
 1/8/22 cmc Finished formatting email table. Need time comparison updated along with legend
 1/12/22 cmc Added time comparison
 1/13/22 cmc Finished pull route and working table email
 1/14/22 cmc Changed table to dropdown
 1/21/22 cmc Finished table formatting (back to table from dropdown) and created CSV
 1/27/22 cmc Added Z1 devices
 1/28/22 cmc Changed table to show WAN1 and WAN2 
 2/26/22 cmc Changed primary uplink to pull from dashboard instead of database
 3/5/22 cmc Changed Not connected from gray to red
 3/11/22 cmc Added option for BLC/HFP in network flag
 3/20/22 cmc Removed blurb about the email
 4/1/22 cmc FINALLY moved csv to a seperate function
 12/4/22 cmc Added network name and wan IPs to the reporting. Additionally, the csv file in the email is finally optinal through a global CSV flag. didn't think of doing this before
 2/24/23 cmc Added public IPs and gateways for WAN1 and 2
 7/21/23 cmc Added error handling for empty networks 
Requirements:
python 3, csv, meraki_functions, sqlite3, datetime, sys, getopt, smtplib, dateutil.parser, email.message.EmailMessage

Global variables:
ORG_NAME -> Name of the organization you wish to run the report on
NET_NAME -> Name of the network you wish to run the report on. Can be a group such as BLC or HFP 

Examples:
Running the script will create and send the email. 

./uplink_log_report.py -k API_KEY -o ORGANIZATION_NAME -n NETWORK_NAME -> -o and -n are oprtional to have a more specific report. default is all for each.
